# Experiment No: 1a Python Basics- Printing Multiline String

## AIM  
To create a Python program to print the string in multiple lines using triple quotes.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Use triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) to define a string that spans multiple lines.  
3. Use the `print()` function to display the multi-line string.  
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
    str1 = '''I am a string literal
    ... has more than one
    ... line
    ... placed inside triple single quotes'''

    str2 = """I am a string literal
    ... has more than one
    ... line
    ... placed inside triple double quotes"""

    print(str1)
    print(str2)
